    <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
    <p>I'm excited to expand my tech skillset in the next two years! Here's my roadmap:

       <li>
        
        <ol>
            <h3>Master a new programming language:</h3> Python's versatility in data analysis and automation interests me. I plan to take an online course and work on personal projects to solidify my understanding.
            <h3>Deepen my web development knowledge:</h3>I want to focus on mastering advanced CSS layouts and exploring a popular JavaScript framework like React. Tutorials and building small web applications will help me achieve this.
            <h3>Explore Machine Learning or Data Science:</h3>The potential of computer vision to solve real-world problems is fascinating. I'll start with online courses and explore introductory projects.
            <h3>Contribute to open-source projects: </h3>Giving back to the tech community is important. I'll look for beginner-friendly projects where I can contribute my skills and learn from experienced developers.
        </ol>
        
       </li> 
    </p>
    <p>In the next two years, I'm dedicated to continuous learning and growth in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
